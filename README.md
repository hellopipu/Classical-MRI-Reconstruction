This repository serves as a re-implementation of several classical Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) reconstruction algorithms that were proposed before the emergence of deep learning. The aim is to provide an accelerated implementation of these algorithms using GPU, making them easy to use and compare with current deep learning-based methods. The codes are written in Python and GPU acceleration is achieved through [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/), while [TorchKbNUFFT](https://torchkbnufft.readthedocs.io/) is used to implement Non-Uniform Fast Fourier Transform (NUFFT).
